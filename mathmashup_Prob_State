Write a function which accepts a number of elements in an array N, an array of integers A, cut-off integer X. A function should return value based on described 3-step operations. 

 

Step-1: Find the elements from an array A, that appears only once. 

E.g.

    N = 20

    A = {-20, 20, -10, 20, 0, 4, 8, -20, 10, -10, 8, 6, 15, 9, 18, 35, 40, -30, -90, 99}

    

Array elements which appeared only once are (order of element should not change). 

= { 0, 4, 10, 6, 15, 9, 18, 35, 40, -30, -90, 99 }

 

Pass this array to a second step. 

Note: If no element found which appeared only once, return -1.

 

Step-2: Find subarrays with first element greater than or equal to last element and the subarray size equal to X.

E.g.

    X = 4

    A = { 0, 4, 10, 6, 15, 9, 18, 35, 40, -30, -90, 99 }

 

The subarrays of size 4 with first element greater than equal to the last element are

{10, 6, 15, 9}, {18, 35, 40, -30}, {35, 40, -30, -90}

 

Pass this list of arrays to the third step. 

Note: If no array found which satisfies above condition return -2. 

 

Step-3: Find the largest value which can be formed by combining the absolute value of each subarray. 

E.g.

The second step generated 3 subarrays, we will find the largest value out of that.

For {10, 6, 15, 9}, the largest value that can be formed is 961510

For {18, 35, 40, -30} the largest value that can be formed is 40353018

For {35, 40, -30, -90} the largest value that can be formed is 90403530

 

Out of these 90403530 is the largest value. Hence function should return 90403530.

 

The main method of a program will accept input and display out in the following format

 

Input

20

-20, 20, -10, 20, 0, 4, 8, -20, 10, -10, 8, 6, 15, 9, 18, 35, 40, -30, -90, 99
4

 

where

First line contains a number of elements in an array. (integer N)
Second line represents array elements (integer array A)
Third line represents Subarray size required for step 2. (integer X)
 

Output

90403530

 

Assumptions:

The array element can range from -99 to +99.
The array can be of size up to 1000. 
The value of X can range from 1 to 1000.
